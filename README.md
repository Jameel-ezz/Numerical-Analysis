The code calculates the derivative of a given function using the numerical method of finite difference. The derivative is calculated by finding the slope of a line that passes through two points on the function, one at x and the other at x + h, where h is the step size. The finite difference method approximates the derivative at x as the slope of this line.

In this code, the cosine function is used as the target function, and the step size h is varied to see how it affects the accuracy of the derivative calculation. The relative errors of the derivative calculation are also calculated to demonstrate how the step size affects the accuracy of the calculation.

Finally, the code plots the cosine function and its derivatives at several points, and overlays a plot of the function -sin(x) to show that the derivative of the cosine function is indeed -sin(x). This plot visually demonstrates the relationship between the cosine and sine functions and their derivatives.
